# Time Series Forecasting - Building Consumption

### Introduction

The file Elec-train.xlsx contains electricity consumption (kW) and outdoor air temperature for one building.
These quantities are measured every 15 minutes, from 1/1/2010 1:15 to 2/17/2010 23:45.
In addition, outdoor air temperature are available for 2/18/2010.

The goal was to forecast electricity consumption (kW) for 2/18/2010.
The first forecast is done without using outdoor temperature, and the second one is done with it.
